# Studio Prototyping Extended 2020

March 2020: This modul started in the first week after the Covid-19 lockdown in Switzerland. Hence, workshop is done entirely via remote-channels. 

## Installation

### Hardware setup

We are using the [Arduino Shield V2 motorshield](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2_Library).

### Software install

Either to manual install by downloading the zip file and put it into the library folder of your Arduino installation. Otherwise use the library manager directly from the Arduino IDE. Make sure that following libraries are installed:

  - [Adafruit Motor Shield Rev2 Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2_Library)
  - [Accelstepper](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/)

I am not using the Arduino IDE for development but instead [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Arduino extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino). You can upload your sketches directly from your text editor.
